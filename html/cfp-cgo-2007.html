<p>
The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)
provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on feedback-directed optimization and back-end
compilation techniques.  The conference covers optimization for
parallelism, performance, power, and security, where that optimization
occurs in the mapping from an input (including APIs, high-level
languages, byte codes such as .NET or Java, or ISAs) to a similar or
lower-level target machine representation.  Papers are solicited in
areas that support such mapping and optimization:

<ul>

<li>Compilers, back-end code generators, translators, binary
optimization tools and runtime environments; static, dynamic,
adaptive, or continuous techniques

<li>Innovative analysis, transformation, and optimization techniques

<li>Profiling and feedback-directed methodologies

<li>Memory management, including data distribution, synchronization
and GC

<li>Thread extraction and thread-level speculation, especially for
multi-core systems

<li>Vertical integration of language features, representations,
optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism (including support
for transactional semantics, efficient message passing, and dynamic
thread creation)

<li>Phase detection and analysis techniques

<li>Mechanisms and optimization techniques supporting the efficient
implementation of security protection models, reliability and energy
efficiency

<li>Traditional compiler optimizations

<li>Intermediate representations that enable more powerful or
efficient optimization

<li>Hardware mechanisms and systems that implement or assist in any of
the above

<li>Experiences with real dynamic optimization and compilation
systems, particularly with large, complex applications

<li>Explorations of trade-offs concerning when (static/dynamic) and
where (software/hardware) to optimize

<li>Particularly novel ideas of interest to this community

</ul>
